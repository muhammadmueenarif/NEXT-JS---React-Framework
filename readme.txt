first of all write command npx create-next-app@latest to create project of next js. it will ask for project name, 
name, use typescript or not(ts recommend), tailwind(yes), src directory or not(old inside src but new not).
we will use src. app router yes and import alias no. move to folder and write npm run dev to start.
we have src folder main folder in which we will work. public folder in which we give public files like images. 
in src we have app folder which contains routes handler for application.files inside app corresponds to routes 
in the application. eg., page.tsx in app is our home route.  globals.css is for styling. 
remove unnecessary code from globals. remove code from page.tsx and return only one heading to see changes.
gitignore file tells what files or folders should be ignored by git. by default it ignores node modules and env
files. package.json to see dependencies and versions. readme file tells how to run project. tailwind.config.ts 
to manage tailwind configuration.
